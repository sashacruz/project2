	 <h3><center>
	Poaching has been illegal for hundreds of years, but it was during the Late Middle Ages that poaching became a punishable offense. During this time, the right to hunt was limited to landowners and nobility. While hunting was reserved for the privileged, it was illegal to buy and sell wild animals. Despite many laws being mad to stop poaching is still a huge problem. It's killing animals at a drastic rate and with new weapons like faster guns it's just made it easier to kill the animal.
